	This course covered\pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modelling techniques that power structure prediction with latent variables in NLP: mixture models, CRFs, VAE \pause
		\item Major learning techniques/algorithms: MLE and (approximate) posterior inference by VI \pause
		\item We also covered some background on logical problems \pause
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item parsing with CFGs and generalisations \pause
				\item hypergraph algorithms: inside, outside, expectation \pause
			\end{itemize}
		\item A bit of math: constrained optimisation, exponential families, semirings		
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	
	Our latent variables:  \pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item alignments (e.g. IBM1) \pause
		\item parameters (e.g. Bayesian IBM1)\pause
		\item trees (e.g. LV-CRF for ITGs)\pause
		\item continuous representations (e.g. VAE)
	\end{itemize}

\frame{
	\frametitle{What else is there?}
	
	Stuff you should learn about
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Other deep generative models: GANs		
		\item Bayesian NNs
		\item Bayesian nonparameteric models
		\item Gaussian Processes		
		\item Global optimisation
		\item Sampling: MC and MCMC		
	\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
	\frametitle{Beyond}
	

	I'll be offering a course on Bayesian NNs (stay tuned!)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item hottest topics in deep generative modelling
		\item e.g. Bayesian GANs and Bayesian VAEs
		\item a dry run might happen as a June course \\
		(email me if you are interested)
		\item lots of theory, applications somewhat toy-ish
		\item small group of students with good ML/statistics background
	\end{itemize} \pause
	
	I'm offering practical projects
	\begin{itemize}
		\item e.g. 6EC courses (1-3 students), dissertation 
		\item more applied problems
		\item findings typically lead to a publication
	\end{itemize} \pause
	
	Important
	\begin{itemize}
		\item None of it is plain supervised learning
		\item none of it is 100\% frequentist
		\item most of it about deep generative models
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Projects}
	
	Examples:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Bayesian attention: model attention weights as a random variable.
		\item Joint modelling for NMT: model a joint distribution and use monolingual data as semi-supervision.
		\item Mixture model for NMT: a mixture model to alleviate the LM bias of NMT.
		\item VAE+CRF project: discrete latent space VAE with approximation given by a CRF.
	\end{enumerate}

\frame{
	\frametitle{What's next?}
	
	First,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item you finish project 3 \pause
		\item we grade project 3 \pause		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Then, 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I fly to a warm place and enjoy a bit of summer \pause
		\item and hopefully you too :D \pause
	\end{itemize}
	
	Finally,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item feel free to contact me in the future
